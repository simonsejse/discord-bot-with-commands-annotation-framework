# discord-bot-with-commands-annotation-framework
A Discord bot implemented in Spring Boot using the JDA API.

This project contains a lot of commands and was my main project for my discord bot until it wasn't anymore. Some of the things might be outdated, e.g., the Spotify API calls, in case they changed their endpoints on their API or if they just changed the structure in general.
